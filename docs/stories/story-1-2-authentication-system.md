# Story 1.2: Authentication System - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user,
I want to sign up and log in securely using Convex authentication,
so that I can access my personalized German learning experience.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing Convex backend and React frontend
- Technology: Convex Auth, React, TypeScript, existing project structure
- Follows pattern: Convex authentication patterns and existing UI components
- Touch points: Convex auth functions, React state management, UI components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. User can create account with email/password via Convex auth
2. User can log in with existing credentials
3. User sessions persist across browser sessions
4. Authentication state is properly managed in UI
5. Secure logout functionality
6. Error handling for invalid credentials
7. User data is securely stored in Convex

**Integration Requirements:**

8. Existing Convex backend functions continue to work unchanged
9. New authentication follows existing Convex auth patterns
10. Integration with existing UI components maintains current behavior
11. Authentication state integrates with existing React state management

**Quality Requirements:**

12. Authentication is covered by appropriate tests
13. Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
14. No regression in existing functionality verified
15. Security best practices followed for credential handling

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Use Convex's built-in authentication system with React state management
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow Convex auth documentation and existing project structure
- **Key Constraints:** Must work with existing Convex backend, maintain security standards, integrate with existing UI

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User registration form implemented and functional
- [ ] User login form implemented and functional
- [ ] Authentication state properly managed in React
- [ ] Session persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Secure logout functionality implemented
- [ ] Error handling for invalid credentials
- [ ] User data securely stored in Convex
- [ ] Integration with existing Convex backend verified
- [ ] UI follows existing design patterns
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing Convex backend integration
- **Mitigation:** Follow existing Convex patterns exactly, test thoroughly
- **Rollback:** Authentication can be disabled without affecting other features

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing Convex APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (user collection)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority** - This is a core requirement for the MVP and must be completed before other user-facing features can be implemented.

## Story Size Estimate

**4 hours** - Single development session focused on authentication implementation

## Dependencies

- Existing Convex backend (✅ Available)
- Existing React frontend (✅ Available)
- Convex authentication configuration (✅ Available in convex/auth.ts)

## Success Criteria

The story is successful when:

1. Users can register and login securely
2. Authentication state is properly managed
3. Sessions persist across browser sessions
4. Integration with existing system is seamless
5. Security standards are maintained
6. No existing functionality is broken
