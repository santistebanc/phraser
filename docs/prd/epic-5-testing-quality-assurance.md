# Epic 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Epic Goal:** Validate the ELO algorithm, LLM quality, and overall system performance with comprehensive testing. This epic ensures the app delivers high-quality learning experiences.

## Story 5.1: ELO Algorithm Validation
As a developer,
I want to validate the ELO algorithm accuracy and stability,
so that users receive appropriately challenging exercises.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Algorithm tested with simulated user data
2. Level calibration accuracy verified
3. Stability mechanisms working correctly
4. Edge cases handled properly
5. Performance benchmarks established
6. Algorithm parameters optimized
7. Testing documentation completed

## Story 5.2: LLM Quality Assurance
As a developer,
I want to ensure LLM-generated content and evaluations are high quality,
so that users receive accurate, helpful feedback.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Content generation quality validated
2. Answer evaluation accuracy tested
3. Response consistency verified
4. Cost optimization implemented
5. Error handling robust
6. Quality metrics established
7. Monitoring and alerting configured

## Story 5.3: End-to-End Testing
As a developer,
I want comprehensive testing of the entire system,
so that the app is reliable and ready for users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Full user journey testing completed
2. Performance testing under load
3. Security testing for authentication and data
4. Accessibility testing for WCAG AA compliance
