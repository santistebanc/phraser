# Frontend Enhancement Overview

## Project Context

**Project Type:** Brownfield UI Enhancement
**Target Application:** Phraser Language Learning App
**Enhancement Scope:** Comprehensive frontend components for expression browsing, exercise interface, progress tracking, and navigation

## Current State

- **Backend:** Convex with 5-table schema (users, expressions, exercises, attempts, progress)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- **Authentication:** Custom implementation with localStorage persistence
- **Current UI:** Basic dashboard with user stats, no learning functionality

## Enhancement Goals

1. **Expression Browser** - Browse and search German expressions with filtering
2. **Exercise Interface** - Interactive practice with AI scoring and feedback
3. **Progress Tracking** - Comprehensive analytics and learning history
4. **Navigation System** - Seamless app navigation and routing
5. **User Profile** - Profile management and preferences

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success

- Users can browse and search expressions with filters
- Users can complete exercises and receive AI-powered feedback
- Users can view detailed progress statistics and learning history
- Users can navigate seamlessly between all app sections
- All existing functionality (auth, dashboard, theme) remains intact

### Technical Success

- All new components follow existing design patterns and styling
- New Convex functions integrate properly with existing authentication
- Performance meets specified requirements (loading times, responsiveness)
- Code quality passes existing linting and TypeScript standards
- Dark/light theme compatibility is maintained across all new components

### User Experience Success

- Navigation feels intuitive and responsive
- Exercise interface provides engaging learning experience
- Progress tracking motivates continued learning
- Overall app feels cohesive and professional
- Mobile and desktop experiences are equally polished

## Integration Strategy

### Code Integration

- Extend existing React component patterns
- Follow established Context API and Convex hooks patterns
- Maintain existing Tailwind CSS design system

### Database Integration

- Use existing Convex schema without modifications
- Leverage existing tables (expressions, exercises, userProgress, exerciseAttempts)
- No schema changes required

### API Integration

- Create new Convex functions following existing patterns
- Proper error handling and return types
- Maintain authentication integration

### UI Integration

- Extend existing Tailwind CSS design system
- Maintain color scheme, typography, and spacing patterns
- Preserve dark/light theme compatibility

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** All new Convex functions must integrate with existing authentication system
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** New features must use existing database schema without requiring schema changes
- **UI/UX Consistency:** All new components must follow existing design patterns, color schemes, and interaction models
- **Performance Impact:** Must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 20%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **New Convex functions may impact existing performance** → Implement pagination, efficient queries, and proper caching
- **Complex exercise interface may affect user experience** → Progressive enhancement with fallback states and clear loading indicators
- **Real-time progress tracking may cause UI blocking** → Optimistic updates and background synchronization

### Integration Risks

- **New components may break existing authentication flow** → Thorough testing of auth integration and session management
- **Navigation changes may confuse existing users** → Maintain familiar patterns while adding new functionality
- **Theme compatibility issues with new components** → Comprehensive testing of dark/light mode across all new components
