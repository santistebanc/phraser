2. Convex integration configured with authentication
3. Shadcn UI installed and configured with custom theme
4. Basic project structure with modular architecture
5. Development environment ready with hot reload
6. Functions exposed to window object for debugging (development only)

## Story 1.2: Authentication System
As a user,
I want to sign up and log in securely,
so that I can access my personalized German learning experience.

2. User can log in with existing credentials
3. User sessions persist across browser sessions
4. Authentication state is properly managed in UI

7. User data is securely stored in Convex

## Story 1.3: Basic UI Framework and Theme System
As a user,
I want to see a clean, ultra-compact interface with theme switching,
so that I can practice German in a distraction-free environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
