# Goals and Background Context

## Goals:
- **G1:** Create a minimal web app for German language practice with 200 high-quality expressions
- **G2:** Implement AI-powered content generation and evaluation for translation exercises
- **G3:** Build an advanced ELO rating system with medium-high stability for accurate level tracking
- **G4:** Deliver an ultra-compact, space-efficient UI with sharp edges and colorful accents
- **G5:** Establish a robust technical foundation using Convex + React + Shadcn UI
- **G6:** Enable one-exercise-at-a-time practice flow with flexible session lengths

## Background Context:
Intermediate to advanced German learners (B2/C1) lack effective tools for practicing nuanced expressions and receiving targeted feedback. Traditional language apps focus on basic vocabulary, while advanced learners need sophisticated expression practice with immediate, contextual feedback. This MVP addresses this gap by creating a minimal web application that leverages LLMs to generate high-quality German expressions, comprehensive usage examples, and diverse translation exercises. The app features an advanced ELO-like rating system that adapts to user performance while maintaining stable ratings for expressions and exercises.
