# Epic 2: Expression Dataset & Content Generation

**Epic Goal:** Create the expression dataset structure, implement LLM-powered content generation for expressions and exercises, and establish the database schema. This epic builds the content foundation that powers the learning experience.

## Story 2.1: Database Schema and Data Model
As a developer,
I want to define the database schema for expressions, exercises, and user data,
so that the app can efficiently store and retrieve learning content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Convex collections defined for users, expressions, exercises, and progress
2. Expression schema includes German text, English meaning, difficulty level, usage examples
3. Exercise schema includes question text, expected answer, difficulty level, expression reference
4. User progress schema tracks level, expression mastery, practice history
5. Proper indexing for efficient queries
6. Data validation using Convex validators

## Story 2.2: LLM Integration for Content Generation
As a developer,
I want to integrate LLM APIs for generating high-quality German expressions and exercises,
so that the app has rich, diverse content for practice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. LLM API integration configured (quality-focused model for content generation)
2. Function to generate German expressions with usage examples
3. Function to generate translation exercises from expressions
4. Content quality validation and filtering
5. Error handling for LLM API failures
6. Rate limiting and cost management
7. Generated content stored in database with metadata

## Story 2.3: Initial Dataset Population
As a developer,
I want to populate the database with 200 high-quality German expressions,
so that users have substantial content for practice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 200 German expressions generated and stored
2. Expressions span all difficulty levels (B1-C2)
3. Each expression has 5 usage examples
4. 5+ translation exercises generated per expression
5. Content quality validated and approved
6. Database properly indexed for performance
7. Content generation logs for tracking and debugging
