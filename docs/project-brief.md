# Project Brief: German Language Learning MVP

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** An AI-powered German language learning application that provides adaptive practice for intermediate to advanced learners (B2/C1 equivalent) using Large Language Models for content generation and real-time evaluation.

**Primary Problem:** Intermediate German learners lack effective tools for practicing nuanced expressions and receiving targeted feedback beyond traditional exercises.

**Target Market:** Intermediate to advanced German language learners seeking to improve fluency and master complex expressions.

**Key Value Proposition:** The most effective and least complicated tool for German language practice, featuring adaptive ELO-like leveling and AI-powered feedback.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Intermediate to advanced German learners struggle to find effective practice tools that provide:
- Real-time, contextual feedback on expression usage
- Adaptive difficulty that matches their current level
- Focus on nuanced expressions and complex language patterns
- Immediate scoring and constructive feedback

**Impact:** Learners plateau at intermediate levels, unable to progress to advanced fluency due to lack of targeted practice opportunities.

**Existing Solutions Gap:** Traditional language apps focus on basic vocabulary and grammar, while advanced learners need sophisticated expression practice with nuanced feedback.

**Urgency:** There's a growing demand for advanced language learning tools as globalization increases the need for professional German proficiency.
