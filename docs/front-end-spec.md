# **Phraser Language Learning App - UI/UX Specification**

## **Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Phraser's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

### **Target User Personas**

**Language Learner (Primary)**: German language students of all levels who want to practice expressions and track their progress. They value clear feedback, engaging exercises, and visible progress indicators.

**Casual Learner (Secondary)**: Users who practice occasionally and prefer simple, intuitive interfaces with minimal cognitive load. They need clear navigation and quick access to practice sessions.

**Progress-Focused Learner (Tertiary)**: Users who are motivated by detailed statistics, mastery levels, and learning analytics. They want comprehensive tracking and achievement systems.

### **Usability Goals**

- **Ease of learning**: New users can start practicing within 2 minutes of first login
- **Efficiency of use**: Regular users can complete a full practice session in under 10 minutes
- **Error prevention**: Clear validation and helpful feedback for all user inputs
- **Memorability**: Infrequent users can return and immediately understand their progress
- **Engagement**: Users feel motivated to continue learning through positive reinforcement

### **Design Principles**

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed
3. **Consistent patterns** - Use familiar UI patterns throughout the application
4. **Immediate feedback** - Every action should have a clear, immediate response
5. **Accessible by default** - Design for all users from the start

    F --> F1[Profile Settings]
    F --> F2[Preferences]
    F --> F3[Account Management]

    B --> G[Theme Toggle]
    B --> H[Logout]
```

### **Navigation Structure**

**Primary Navigation:** Top navigation bar with main sections (Dashboard, Expressions, Exercises, Progress, Profile) and user account controls

**Secondary Navigation:** Breadcrumbs for deep navigation and contextual actions within each section

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Show current location and provide quick navigation back to parent sections

## **User Flows**

### **Flow 1: Expression Browsing and Practice**

**User Goal:** Find and practice German expressions at appropriate difficulty level

**Entry Points:** Dashboard "Start Learning" button, Expression Browser navigation

**Success Criteria:** User finds relevant expressions and can start practicing immediately

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User lands on Dashboard] --> B[Click 'Start Learning' or 'Expressions']
    B --> C[Expression Browser loads]
    C --> D[User sees filtered expressions]
    D --> E{User wants to filter?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Apply category/difficulty filters]
    E -->|No| G[Browse expressions]
    F --> G
    G --> H[User selects expression]
    H --> I[Expression detail view]
    I --> J[User clicks 'Practice']
    J --> K[Exercise interface loads]
    K --> L[User completes exercise]
    L --> M[AI scoring and feedback]
    M --> N[Progress updated]
    N --> O[Return to browser or continue]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- No expressions available for selected filters
- Network errors during loading
- User session expires during practice
- Exercise fails to load or score

**Notes:** Filtering should be intuitive with clear visual feedback. Practice flow should be seamless with minimal friction.

### **Flow 2: Progress Tracking and Analytics**

**User Goal:** View learning progress and understand improvement areas

**Entry Points:** Dashboard progress cards, Progress navigation, Exercise completion

**Success Criteria:** User gains insights into their learning journey and feels motivated

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User accesses Progress section] --> B[Progress overview loads]
    B --> C[User sees key metrics]
    C --> D{User wants details?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Drill down to specific areas]
    D -->|No| F[Continue browsing]
    E --> G[Detailed progress view]
    G --> H[User reviews learning history]
    H --> I[User identifies weak areas]
    I --> J[User plans next practice session]
    F --> K[Return to main flow]
    J --> K
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- No progress data available
- Incomplete data for new users
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Privacy concerns with progress data

**Notes:** Progress should be visually engaging with charts and clear metrics. Focus on positive reinforcement and achievable goals.

### **Flow 3: Exercise Practice and Feedback**

**User Goal:** Complete exercises and receive helpful feedback to improve

**Entry Points:** Expression detail view, Dashboard quick practice, Progress recommendations

**Success Criteria:** User completes exercise with clear understanding of performance

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User starts exercise] --> B[Exercise interface loads]
    B --> C[User reads question/context]
    C --> D[User provides answer]
    D --> E[AI processes answer]
    E --> F[Immediate feedback shown]
    F --> G[Detailed explanation provided]
    G --> H[Progress updated]
    H --> I{User wants to continue?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Next exercise or expression]
    I -->|No| K[Return to previous screen]
    J --> L[Repeat exercise flow]
    K --> M[Save progress and exit]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- AI scoring fails or is unavailable
- User provides invalid input
- Exercise times out
- Network connectivity issues

**Notes:** Feedback should be immediate and constructive. AI scoring should feel fair and educational.
