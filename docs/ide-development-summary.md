## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19** - Latest React with hooks
- **TypeScript 5.7.2** - Type safety and IntelliSense
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0.14** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite 6.2.0** - Fast development server
- **TanStack Router** - Type-safe client-side routing

### Backend

- **Convex 1.23.0** - Serverless database + functions
- **Existing Schema** - 5 tables (users, expressions, exercises, attempts, progress)
- **Authentication** - Custom implementation with localStorage

### Development Tools

- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code quality and formatting
- **npm** - Package management
- **Convex Dashboard** - Backend management

## New Components to Create

### Core Components

1. **`src/components/Navigation.tsx`** - App navigation with routing
2. **`src/components/ExpressionBrowser.tsx`** - Browse and search expressions
3. **`src/components/ExerciseInterface.tsx`** - Interactive exercise practice
4. **`src/components/ProgressTracker.tsx`** - Progress analytics and charts
5. **`src/components/UserProfile.tsx`** - User profile management

### Convex Functions

1. **`convex/expressions.ts`** - Expression browsing and search
2. **`convex/exercises.ts`** - Exercise management and scoring
3. **`convex/progress.ts`** - Progress tracking and analytics

## Integration Guidelines

### Existing System Integration

- **Authentication:** Extend existing `AuthContext` and auth functions
- **Theme:** Maintain existing dark/light theme compatibility
- **Styling:** Follow existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- **Database:** Use existing schema without modifications

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, proper type definitions
- **React:** Functional components with hooks
- **Convex:** Follow existing function patterns
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests for all components

### Performance Requirements

- **Initial Load:** < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Navigation:** < 1 second
- **Exercise Loading:** < 2 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** < 20% increase

## Development Commands

### Setup

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-router
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development (frontend + backend)
npm run dev:frontend     # Start frontend only
npm run dev:backend      # Start Convex backend only
```

### Deployment

```bash
npx convex deploy        # Deploy Convex functions
npm run build            # Build for production
```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Component and function testing
- **Integration Tests:** API and component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests:** Complete user journey testing
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance testing

### Code Quality

- **ESLint:** Follow existing linting rules
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode compliance
- **Performance:** Meet specified performance targets
- **Accessibility:** Screen reader and keyboard navigation support

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Complex exercise interface** ‚Üí Progressive enhancement with fallbacks
- **AI scoring performance** ‚Üí Implement caching and fallback scoring
- **Real-time updates** ‚Üí Optimistic updates with background sync

### Integration Risks

- **Authentication integration** ‚Üí Thorough testing of auth flows
- **Theme compatibility** ‚Üí Comprehensive dark/light mode testing
- **Mobile responsiveness** ‚Üí Mobile-first development approach

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success

- Users can browse and search expressions with filters
- Users can complete exercises and receive AI-powered feedback
- Users can view detailed progress statistics and learning history
- Users can navigate seamlessly between all app sections
- All existing functionality (auth, dashboard, theme) remains intact

### Technical Success

- All new components follow existing design patterns and styling
- New Convex functions integrate properly with existing authentication
- Performance meets specified requirements (loading times, responsiveness)
- Code quality passes existing linting and TypeScript standards
- Dark/light theme compatibility is maintained across all new components

### User Experience Success

- Navigation feels intuitive and responsive
- Exercise interface provides engaging learning experience
- Progress tracking motivates continued learning
- Overall app feels cohesive and professional
- Mobile and desktop experiences are equally polished

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1:** Begin with navigation and basic Convex functions
2. **Follow Story Order:** Implement stories in the specified order
3. **Test Continuously:** Test each component as it's developed
4. **Deploy Incrementally:** Deploy Convex functions as they're created
5. **Monitor Performance:** Track performance metrics throughout development
